# Research: Knowledge Layer

**Feature**: 003-knowledge-layer · **Date**: 2026-07-07
All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the Technical Context are resolved below.

## R1. Module placement — new `knowledge` bounded context

**Decision**: A new Gradle module `knowledge` (the 11th BC), exposing retrieval as an Open Host
Service. `persona` defines a `KnowledgeProvider` SPI (same pattern as the existing `persona/spi`
package); `knowledge` implements it; `app` wires the implementation. `knowledge` may depend on
`tenancy`, `catalog`, and `casecore` types, but `persona` never depends on `knowledge`.

**Rationale**: The phase plan names "Knowledge Retrieval Svc" as its own service with an OHS
boundary (E3.1), and the knowledge lifecycle (capture → curation → publish → deprecate) has a
governance and API surface disjoint from persona execution. Folding it into `persona` would fuse
two bounded contexts and create a cycle the moment orchestration needs capture delegates.
Constitution IV's "extend existing structure" preference is satisfied: this is a named BC with
demonstrated need, not speculative structure.

**Alternatives considered**: package inside `persona` — rejected (BC fusion, cycle risk, and the
capture pipeline has nothing to do with persona execution mechanics); package inside `catalog` —
rejected (KnowledgeItems are workspace content with a runtime lifecycle, not governed definitions
distributed by the catalog; only the Curator persona/rubric are catalog assets).

## R2. Per-workspace vector index partitioning (T2-b)

**Decision**: `knowledge_item` is **LIST-partitioned by `workspace_id`**, one partition per
workspace, created by the tenancy provisioning hook at workspace creation (same transactional
path that creates the workspace row). Each partition carries its own HNSW index on the `embedding
vector` column. The parent table carries the standard RLS policy (`app.workspace_id` session
setting) — partitioning and RLS are independent layers.

**Rationale**: T2-b's requirement is that similarity search be *structurally* incapable of
returning another workspace's items — with LIST partitions, an ANN scan is confined to the
caller's partition (partition pruning on the mandatory `workspace_id = ?` predicate), so even a
mis-scoped query cannot traverse foreign vectors. HNSW-per-partition also keeps recall/latency
stable per tenant instead of degrading as the global corpus grows. RLS stays on as the second
layer (defense in depth), consistent with every other table.

**Alternatives considered**: single table + RLS only — rejected (RLS filters rows *after* index
traversal; a policy bug would be a leak, and T2-b explicitly demands a partitioned index); hash
partitioning (fixed N) — rejected (co-locates multiple workspaces per partition, which defeats the
isolation argument); one physical table per workspace managed by the app — rejected (reinvents
declarative partitioning with more DDL surface and no pruning support).

## R3. Embeddings — AI Gateway `embed` operation

**Decision**: Extend `AiGatewayClient` with an `embed(EmbedRequest) → EmbedResult` operation
(text → float vector + model identity/version), implemented in `HttpAiGatewayClient` against the
provider's embeddings endpoint and in `StubAiGatewayClient` as a **deterministic hash-derived
vector** (seeded from content bytes) so Testcontainers ITs are reproducible without a provider.
Embedding happens once, at item publish (and re-embed on new version); the model id/version used
is recorded on the item version row.

**Rationale**: AS-5/Constitution constraint — LLM/provider access only via the AI Gateway, and
model identity must be recorded per execution (Principle II). Embedding at publish time (not at
query time per item) keeps retrieval read-only and fast; query-side embedding is one gateway call
per retrieval. Deterministic stub vectors keep replay and leakage suites free of network flakes.

**Alternatives considered**: local embedding library in-process — rejected (violates the
gateway-only rule and adds a native dependency); embedding lazily at first retrieval — rejected
(makes the first retrieval slow and pushes writes into the read path).

> **Re-index contract (v1, gap-1 remediation).** Cosine distance is only meaningful between vectors
> produced by the *same* embedding model, so item vectors and query vectors must share a model. Two
> guards enforce this: (a) `embed-dimensions` is requested from the provider and validated on the
> response (`EmbeddingDimensionException`), and the DB column is `VECTOR(384)` — so a *dimension* swap
> fails loud and additionally needs a migration; (b) `KnowledgeRetrievalService` ranks only rows whose
> `embed_model` equals the model that just produced the query vector (an `embed_model = ?` predicate,
> the model string built identically on both sides as `modelId:modelVersion`). After a same-dimension
> *model* swap, items embedded under the prior model fall out of the entitled set — retrieval returns
> fewer/zero items (a visible, safe signal) instead of mis-ranking across vector spaces. **Changing
> `embed-model`/`embed-dimensions` therefore requires re-embedding existing items** (publish new
> versions through `EmbeddingIndexer` under the new model). No in-place re-embed job ships in v1 — a
> model swap is an explicit operational migration, not a config toggle. A batch re-embed job is the
> natural follow-on when a model change is actually needed.

## R4. Scope lattice representation

**Decision**: Two-level lattice in v1, encoded as `scope_level` (`WORKSPACE` | `PROJECT`) +
`scope_ref` (workspace id or project id). Retrieval resolves the requesting operation's context
(workspace, project) and returns items whose scope is an **ancestor-or-equal** of that context
(workspace-scoped items visible to all projects in the workspace; project-scoped items visible
only inside their project), intersected with tag match and the persona's knowledge profile
(allowed tags/domains carried on the PersonaDefinition). Capture candidates are born
`PROJECT`-scoped and confidential; the D4 gate is what raises scope to `WORKSPACE`.

**Rationale**: This is the minimal lattice that expresses Q5's boundary ("project-confidential
until promoted") without inventing levels the spec doesn't need. Cross-*workspace* promotion (to
a global library) is explicitly out of scope until Phase 6's copy-on-subscribe machinery exists —
the lattice tops out at WORKSPACE in v1 and the design leaves `scope_level` extensible
(`GLOBAL` reserved, unreachable in v1).

**Alternatives considered**: full generalized lattice table (arbitrary DAG of scopes) — rejected
(speculative structure, Constitution IV); per-case scope level — rejected (nothing retrieves at
case granularity; candidates are per-case but scoping is project/workspace).

## R5. Injection point and snapshot write

**Decision**: `ExecutionEnvelopeBuilder` gains a knowledge slot: before prompt rendering it calls
the `KnowledgeProvider` SPI with (workspace, project, operation tags, persona profile), renders
returned items into the envelope **as delimited data** (same T1-a framing as submission text), and
hands the resolved `(item id, version)` list to `OperationExecutionRecorder`, which writes
`knowledge_injection_snapshot` rows **in the same transaction** as the `operation_execution` row.
The AI Gateway receives the caller's workspace id with the call and independently re-asserts that
every injected item's workspace matches before prompt assembly (T2-c) — mismatch → refuse + audit.

**Rationale**: Same-transaction snapshot is what preserves Principle II/III (an execution either
exists with its full knowledge provenance or not at all). Reusing the delimited-data framing keeps
knowledge on the data side of the injection boundary (AD-12). The gateway assertion is deliberately
redundant with R2's partitioning — T2-c requires the check at the injection seam, not only at
retrieval.

**Alternatives considered**: snapshot written asynchronously after execution — rejected (a crash
window would leave executions with unrecorded knowledge provenance, breaking replay); recording
only item ids without versions — rejected (FR-006/AD-1: `(id, version)`, never a mutable pointer).

## R6. Case-end capture trigger and process shape

**Decision**: A standalone **`knowledge-capture` BPMN process**, started by
`CaseDeliveredKnowledgeTrigger` when the Case reaches `Delivered`, correlated by `caseInstanceId`.
Process shape: capture service task (harvest candidates from the case's artifacts/decisions) →
deterministic pre-filter service task → Curator redaction service task → **D4 review** (workspace
owner approve/reject) → publish or reject. Escalation/wait semantics reuse Phase 2's
`EscalationBridge`/receiveTask pattern.

> **Accepted deviations (v1, see tasks.md T035/T036):**
> - **Trigger mechanism:** `CaseDeliveredKnowledgeTrigger` is a `@Scheduled` sweep over Flowable's
>   non-RLS history for finished `initiation-v2` instances, **not** an outbox-event relay —
>   `event_outbox` is RLS-scoped + append-only (`REVOKE UPDATE/DELETE`), so a "flip published_at"
>   relay is structurally impossible. Idempotent by case business key; mirrors `ReconciliationJob`.
>   Consequence to note: because it is keyed to `initiation-v2`, Phase 4 case types do **not** get
>   capture for free by this mechanism — the sweep (or a generalized successor) must be extended per
>   delivering process, and capture latency equals the sweep interval.
> - **Curator step:** produced **deterministically** (the pre-filter already excluded PII), not via
>   the persona path — the delivered case's frozen `CaseDefinitionSnapshot` pins only the initiation
>   suite, so `knowledge-curator` is not resolvable there and the snapshot is immutable (Principle I).
>   No curation rubric is scored on this path; the substantive human gate in v1 is D4. The persona/
>   playbook/rubric/prompt are seeded for provenance and a later capture-time snapshot.
> - **D4:** modeled as a `receiveTask` wait released by the `POST .../d4` endpoint (which is the
>   authoritative publisher), not a Flowable user task.

**Rationale**: A standalone process keeps the initiation workflow definition untouched — running
and pinned cases are unaffected (Principle I). The D4 gate stays a lightweight in-process wait +
Decision row in v1 — the first-class Review/Approval-Gate subprocess is explicitly Phase 5;
building it early would duplicate E5.1.

> **Accepted limitation (v1, gap-4): capture start/release is single-node safe, not multi-node safe.**
> `CaseDeliveredKnowledgeTrigger` uses a check-then-start (query for an existing capture instance by case
> business key, then start one) with no DB/Flowable business-key uniqueness constraint, and
> `CaptureService.captureFrom` is idempotent by existing candidates. On a single node these serialize
> correctly; across nodes two schedulers could pass the check simultaneously and double-start. That is
> accepted for v1 (single-region single-node deployment, per spec Assumptions). One near-free robustness
> fix *is* applied now: `CaptureWaitReleaserImpl` releases the D4 wait with `list()` (releasing every
> match) rather than `singleResult()`, which would *throw* if duplicate instances ever shared a business
> key — so a stray duplicate degrades to a harmless redundant trigger, never an exception. Full multi-node
> safety (a `UNIQUE`/business-key backstop on `capture_candidate(case_instance_id)` for revision 1 and a
> Flowable business-key guard) is deferred to the horizontal-scale workstream, not built in v1.

**Alternatives considered**: callActivity appended to initiation-v3 — rejected (requires a new
workflow version per case type per Phase, couples capture to authoring workflows, no benefit);
purely service-driven pipeline without BPMN — rejected (the human D4 wait state needs the engine's
durable user task + restart survival, same reason gates are engine-managed elsewhere).

## R7. Sensitivity/PII pre-filter — deterministic, not AI

**Decision**: `SensitivityPreFilter` is a **deterministic classifier**: pattern detectors (email,
phone, national-id/IBAN-like, credential/secret shapes) plus propagation of the intake field-level
sensitivity tags (T3-a, E1.3) carried on the source submission/artifacts. Output is
`prefilter_finding` rows (span, category, source) attached to the candidate; findings pre-populate
the Curator's redaction view, and fields tagged sensitive are **excluded by default** from the
candidate content before the Curator ever sees them (T3-c).

**Rationale**: The pre-filter is an assist gate whose job is recall on *known* shapes with an
auditable, reproducible verdict — a deterministic pass is replayable byte-for-byte and cannot
hallucinate a clean bill. The spec makes the human redaction step authoritative precisely so the
pre-filter doesn't need semantic judgment. An AI-assisted second-opinion pass can be added later as
an additional (never replacing) filter without schema change.

**Alternatives considered**: LLM-based PII detection — rejected for v1 (non-deterministic verdicts
in a compliance gate, cost per candidate, and the human step already covers semantic cases);
external DLP service — rejected (new vendor surface, AS-5 gateway-only posture, overkill at this
scale).

## R8. Deprecation flagging mechanics

**Decision**: `DeprecationService.deprecate(itemKey, version-range, reason)` — in one
transaction: set item status `DEPRECATED` (audited governance action recorded as an **AuditEntry**),
and insert one `knowledge_affected_execution` row per distinct `operation_execution` whose injection
snapshot references a deprecated version (derived by a single insert-select over
`knowledge_injection_snapshot`). Flags are their own append-only rows; snapshots and outputs are
never touched. New retrievals exclude `DEPRECATED` items by status predicate; in-flight envelopes
already built keep their snapshotted versions.

> **Accepted deviation (v1, tasks.md T040):** the governance record is an immutable **`AuditEntry`**,
> not a `decision` row. The V4 `decision` table is `NOT NULL case_instance_id` and CHECK-constrains
> `decision_type` to the case D-gates (D1–D4); a knowledge-item deprecation is bound to no single
> case and is not a D-gate, so the `audit_entry` stream is the correct system-of-record vehicle for
> FR-016. (Item byte-immutability across a status flip is additionally enforced by the V16 trigger.)

**Rationale**: FR-014/015/016 verbatim — discoverability requires a queryable flag artifact (an
operator lists affected executions per SC-007), and materializing flags at deprecation time makes
the flag itself auditable ("what was known-affected, when, why") rather than a moving query result.
Insert-select in the same transaction gives an exact, point-in-time affected set.

**Alternatives considered**: purely derived view (join snapshots × deprecated items at query time)
— rejected (the affected set silently changes as items change state; no audit anchor); mutating a
flag column on `operation_execution` — rejected (touches Phase 1 runtime rows and mixes concerns;
append-only side table is cleaner and RLS-scoped the same way).

> **Accepted limitation (v1, gap-2): flagging is point-in-time at deprecation, not real-time
> exhaustive under concurrency.** The insert-select captures exactly the executions whose snapshots are
> committed *when it runs*. An operation whose envelope was built while the item was still PUBLISHED but
> whose execution+snapshot commit *after* the insert-select is never flagged — and FR-014 explicitly
> permits that in-flight execution to keep its snapshotted version, so such rows exist by design. SC-007's
> "flags 100%" therefore holds for the demonstration set (single-node, single-threaded ITs) but is not a
> real-time invariant under concurrent deprecation. This is accepted for v1: deployment is single-region
> single-node and the flag is an operator-review discoverability aid, not a correctness gate (history is
> never rewritten either way — FR-016 holds unconditionally). The clean future closure is a
> **reconciliation sweep** mirroring `orchestration/ReconciliationJob`: because `FLAG_AFFECTED_SQL` is
> already `NOT EXISTS`-idempotent, a periodic re-run over DEPRECATED items would catch late-committing
> executions and make the 100% claim eventually-consistent. Not built in v1.

## R9. Knowledge-influence KPI (E3.4)

**Decision**: `InfluenceEvaluationService` runs an explicit, on-demand **paired evaluation**: for a
target (item, **a case + persona step**, fixed input set), execute the operation twice — once with
the item force-included, once with it force-excluded — score both outputs against the same
RubricDefinition version, and emit
`kpi_sample(metric='knowledge_influence', value = score_with − score_without)` tagged with the
item key/version. Both runs record full OperationExecution snapshots (they are real, replayable
executions, flagged `evaluation=true` so they never feed delivery). Items never injected anywhere
report `not-yet-measurable` (no sample emitted, API returns the state explicitly).

> **Accepted deviations (v1, tasks.md T046/T047):**
> - **Evaluation target** is `{caseId, personaKey}`, **not** a bare operation-definition key: a
>   rubric version resolves only through a case's pinned `CaseDefinitionSnapshot` (Principle I), so
>   a bare operation key cannot supply the scoring rubric. `contracts/api.yaml` was updated to match;
>   the run is synchronous (deterministic stub gateway) and returns the `InfluenceResult` with a 202.
> - **KPI schema**: the V9 `kpi_sample.metric` CHECK forbids new metric names, so V15 widens that
>   CHECK to include `knowledge_influence` and adds a `dimensions JSONB` column (with a partial index
>   on `key`/`version`). This is the minimal reconciliation of the "no new observability schema" goal.

**Rationale**: The spec defines the metric as a with/without rubric delta (Clarifications); the
only honest way to produce it is actually running both arms under identical inputs and rubric
version. The evaluation still records snapshots, inherits budget enforcement, and audits each run.

**Alternatives considered**: observational estimation from historical runs (compare cases that
happened to use the item vs. not) — rejected (confounded, not attributable per item, spec asks for
the controlled delta); making the evaluation a delivery gate — rejected (spec: KPI is stewardship
reporting, it "does not itself gate delivery").

## R10. Retrieval query shape and budget

**Decision**: Retrieval = single SQL query per operation: mandatory predicates
(`workspace_id = :ws`, status `PUBLISHED`, `embed_model =` the current query model (R3 re-index
contract), scope ancestor-or-equal of the operation's context, tag overlap with operation tags ∩
persona profile) ordered by vector similarity to the operation's context embedding (embedded via one
gateway `embed` call on the operation's task framing), capped at
`d2os.knowledge.max-items-per-operation` (default 5). The existing TokenBudgetGuard accounts the
injected tokens against the per-case budget. Budget: ≤ 500 ms p95 at seeded scale, measured in
KnowledgeRetrievalIT.

> **Scope wiring (v1, gap-6 remediation).** `ExecutionEnvelopeBuilder` resolves the operation's project
> through the `case_instance → feature → project_version` chain (the same two-hop lookup `CaptureService`
> uses) and passes it as the query's `projectId`, so the PROJECT branch of the scope lattice is reached
> by real persona operations — not only by direct SPI calls in tests. Resolution is best-effort: if the
> feature chain is unresolvable (e.g. a persona-only slice test), `projectId` is null and only
> WORKSPACE-scoped items are eligible, never an error on the injection path.

> **No per-item token ceiling (v1, gap-5 remediation).** An earlier draft carried a
> `d2os.knowledge.per-item-token-ceiling` config intending to truncate/skip oversized items at envelope
> insertion; it was never read. It is **removed**, not implemented: truncating an item's content after
> retrieval already computed its `content_hash` would diverge the injected bytes from the snapshotted
> hash, breaking the injection-snapshot/replay contract (FR-006/FR-007). Prompt growth is instead bounded
> by the item-count cap (`max-items-per-operation`) plus per-case token budget accounting — sufficient
> for NFR-7 without touching the byte-for-byte replay guarantee.

**Rationale**: Deterministic filters do the isolation/governance work; similarity only ranks
within the already-entitled set — so a ranking bug can mis-order but never widen entitlement.
Capping items + counting their tokens against the existing per-case budget keeps NFR-7 intact now
that prompts grow.

**Alternatives considered**: rerank via LLM — rejected for v1 (cost/latency per operation, no
requirement); no cap — rejected (unbounded prompt growth breaks the token budget posture).
