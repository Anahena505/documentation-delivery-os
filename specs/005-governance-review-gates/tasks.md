# Tasks: Governance & Review Gates

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-governance-review-gates/`

**Prerequisites**: [plan.md](plan.md), [spec.md](spec.md), [research.md](research.md), [data-model.md](data-model.md), [contracts/api.yaml](contracts/api.yaml), [quickstart.md](quickstart.md)

**Tests**: Included — spec SC-001…SC-008 and the six quickstart IT suites (GateFlow, CommentRegenerate, ReopenPolicy, EscalationTimer, AuditChain, PackageAccess) plus the DR runbook and a Phase-1–4 regression pass are the acceptance evidence.

**Organization**: Grouped by user story (US1–US6, priority order from spec.md). Builds on the Phase 1–4 modular monolith and **adds the new `governance` Gradle module (BC-7)**; extends `orchestration`, `casecore`, `artifacts`, `tenancy`, `catalog`, and `app` tests. Migrations continue the ordered stream at **V17 (governance), V18 (casecore audit chain), V19 (artifacts grants), V20 (tenancy retention columns)**.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependency on an incomplete task)
- **[Story]**: Maps to spec.md user stories US1–US6
- All descriptions include exact file paths per the module layout in [plan.md](plan.md)

## Path Conventions (from plan.md)

Modular monolith: `<module>/src/main/java/com/d2os/<module>/…`, migrations in `<module>/src/main/resources/db/migration/`, BPMN/DMN in `orchestration/src/main/resources/{processes,dmn}/`, integration tests in `app/src/test/java/com/d2os/app/`. New bounded context `governance/` registered in `settings.gradle`. Ops runbook in `ops/`.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Stand up the new `governance` module, dependencies, and config — no business logic yet.

- [X] T001 Create the `governance` Gradle module: add `governance/build.gradle` (Spring Boot, JPA, Flyway, Flowable deps mirroring `orchestration/build.gradle`) and register `include 'governance'` in `settings.gradle`; wire `app` to depend on `:governance` in `app/build.gradle`
- [X] T002 [P] Add `java-diff-utils` (deterministic delta reports, research R2) to `governance/build.gradle`
- [X] T003 [P] Add Phase 5 config keys to `app/src/main/resources/application.yml`: `d2os.governance.sla.default-durations` (fallback when an EscalationPolicy omits a per-step duration — policy value wins, R4), `d2os.governance.retention.default-years: 7` (NFR-5, R6) — audit-chain sealing is a fixed hourly interval per FR-013 (no cadence config key); notifications are in-app only in v1 (no delivery-channel config; no email/webhook, R4)
- [X] T004 [P] Scaffold `ops/dr-drill.md` (empty section headers: Backup regime, Restore procedure, RPO/RTO measurement, Results) to be filled in US6 (research R7, NFR-8)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: All V17–V20 schema, the engine↔governance bridge, and the new definition-asset types every story depends on. MUST complete before any US phase.

> **Renumbering note (as implemented)**: V17/V18/V19 were already taken by Phase 4 migrations
> (`tenancy/V17__feature_mutating_guard.sql`, `intake/V18__case_type_classification.sql`,
> `casecore/V19__decision_case_instance_optional.sql`) by the time this phase was implemented —
> Flyway's `classpath:db/migration` namespace is global across every module (see
> `app/src/main/resources/application.yml`). The four migrations below were renumbered to the actual
> next-free integers, same relative order, shifted by +3: **V20** (governance), **V21** (casecore
> audit chain), **V22** (artifacts grants), **V23** (tenancy retention columns). A fifth migration not
> anticipated by this task list, `catalog/src/main/resources/db/migration/V24__governance_definition_types.sql`,
> was also added — required for T011's `SUBPROCESS`/`ESCALATION_POLICY` seed rows to pass
> `definition_asset`'s `type` CHECK constraint (V3, catalog-owned).

- [X] T005 Create `gate_instance`, `impact_assessment`, `gate_reopen_candidate`, `escalation_activation`, `delta_report`, and `in_app_notification` tables (each with `workspace_id`, RLS policy, `d2os_app` grants; `escalation_activation` append-only per data-model) in `governance/src/main/resources/db/migration/V20__governance_gates.sql`
- [X] T006 [P] Create `audit_chain_segment` table (per-workspace chain: `segment_seq` UNIQUE per workspace, `segment_hash`/`prev_segment_hash`, RLS + grants, append-only — T6-b) in `casecore/src/main/resources/db/migration/V21__audit_hash_chain.sql` (also relaxes `decision.decision_type`'s CHECK constraint to admit the Phase 5 gate verbs — see T006 note below)
- [X] T007 [P] Create `package_access_grant` table (`(workspace_id, package_id, role)` UNIQUE, `granted_by`, `revoked_at`, RLS + grants — T3-d) in `artifacts/src/main/resources/db/migration/V22__package_access_grants.sql`
- [X] T008 [P] Add `retention_years int NOT NULL DEFAULT 7` and `retention_policy_notes text` columns to `workspace` (columns only — NFR-5, R6) in `tenancy/src/main/resources/db/migration/V23__workspace_retention.sql`
- [X] T009 Implement `GateInstance` entity/repository (state machine OPEN→APPROVED/REJECTED/REGENERATING/REOPEN_CANDIDATE/REOPENED per data-model) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/GateInstance.java` + `GateInstanceRepository.java`
- [X] T010 Implement `GateTaskBridge` (engine userTask ↔ `GateInstance` sync: create the gate row when the gate callActivity spawns its user task, correlate `engine_task_id`, complete the task on decide — same coupling pattern as `PersonaStepDelegate`) in `orchestration/src/main/java/com/d2os/orchestration/GateTaskBridge.java` (research R1) — **T010 scope note**: only the create-gate-row-on-userTask-create half is implemented (a Flowable `TaskListener`); it is not yet referenced by any BPMN (that wiring, plus the complete-task-on-decide half, is T012/T013/T014, Phase 3)
- [X] T011 Seed the two gate `SUBPROCESS` DefinitionAssets and the `ESCALATION_POLICY` DefinitionAsset as new `definition_asset` `type` values (content-level, not schema) via `catalog/src/main/java/com/d2os/catalog/CatalogSeedLoader.java` (data-model Modified Entities; R1/R4)

**Checkpoint**: Phase 5 schema (V20–V23), gate aggregate, engine bridge, and definition-asset types ready — user story phases can begin.

**T006 decision_type note (as implemented)**: `decision.decision_type` (casecore V4) was `CHECK
(decision_type IN ('D1','D2','D3','D4'))`; `'D4'` already has a specific meaning (the Knowledge
Curator promotion gate, `PromotionGateService`) so Phase 5 gate decisions do not reuse it. V21 drops
and recreates the constraint to additionally admit `'GATE_APPROVE'`, `'GATE_REJECT'`,
`'GATE_REQUEST_CHANGES'`, `'GATE_REOPEN'` — landed in casecore's own migration (the table's owning
module), matching this repo's existing precedent of a table's owning module altering that table's
constraints (e.g. `observability/V15` widening `kpi_sample`'s CHECK) rather than a cross-module
migration from `governance`.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Every decision flows through a first-class gate with a tamper-evident record (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Promote inline D4 review/approval to reusable Review-Gate / Approval-Gate subprocesses producing a complete who/what/when/on-what/why Decision record, with full outbox payloads.

**Independent Test**: Run a case to a governance point → the decision is made through a gate subprocess with a reviewer view (`GET /gates/{id}` shows artifacts + exact inputs), and the recorded Decision names reviewer, reviewed artifacts/inputs, timestamp, and outcome — verifiable in the audit trail.

- [X] T012 [US1] Author `orchestration/src/main/resources/processes/review-gate.bpmn20.xml` (callActivity subprocess: userTask → decision gateway routing on the verb; APPROVE/REJECT/REQUEST_CHANGES paths) (research R1, FR-001)
- [X] T013 [P] [US1] Author `orchestration/src/main/resources/processes/approval-gate.bpmn20.xml` (callActivity subprocess: userTask carrying boundary-timer attach points for US4; verb routing) (research R1, FR-001)
- [X] T014 [US1] Implement `GateService.open(...)` and `GateService.decide(...)` — exactly three verbs APPROVE/REJECT/REQUEST_CHANGES; writes the `GateInstance` transition + Decision + AuditEntry in the **same transaction**; captures `inputs_ref` (artifact revisions, rubric scores, delta report id) at open; enforces reviewer role + non-self-review (FR-018) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/GateService.java` (research R1, FR-002/003/004)
- [X] T015 [US1] Embed the gate callActivities into new workflow versions `initiation-v3`, `assessment-v2`, `enhancement-v2` (running cases keep pinned prior versions — Principle I) and publish via `catalog/src/main/java/com/d2os/catalog/CatalogSeedLoader.java` (data-model Modified Entities; FR-001) — **gap**: `enhancement-v2` NOT seeded — `case_type.enhancement`/`workflow.enhancement` don't exist anywhere in this codebase yet (spec 004 US3 unbuilt), so there is nothing to version; `initiation-v3` and `assessment-v2` are fully seeded with real gate-embedded BPMN
- [X] T016 [US1] Implement gate lifecycle outbox emission per the `GateEventPayload` contract (GATE_OPENED, GATE_DECIDED — projection-sufficient tuple, no aggregate back-read) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/GateEventPublisher.java` (research R8, FR-019)
- [X] T017 [US1] Implement `GateController` (`GET /gates` worklist, `GET /gates/{gateId}` full view with resolved `inputs_ref`, `POST /gates/{gateId}/decision` — three verbs only, 403 self-review/role, 409 non-decidable) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/api/GateController.java` (contracts/api.yaml; FR-002)
- [X] T018 [US1] Add `GateFlowIT` in `app/src/test/java/com/d2os/app/GateFlowIT.java`: D4 flows through a gate subprocess; Decision records reviewer/inputs/timestamp/outcome; the same gate definition key/version serves Initiation + Assessment + Enhancement; **and every emitted outbox event validates against `GateEventPayload`** (SC-001, FR-019 payload-contract assertions) — drives Assessment (assessment-v2) through the gate; covers APPROVE→Delivered, REJECT→409 on redecide, REQUEST_CHANGES→reviewerComments, and self-review→403; cannot actually run in this environment (no Docker) — traced by hand against the real code, not asserted to pass

**Checkpoint**: US1 independently testable — every decision flows through a reusable gate with a complete Decision record and projection-sufficient events.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Reviewers comment and regenerate rather than editing AI content (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: REQUEST_CHANGES re-enters the persona path to produce a new immutable completion plus a deterministic delta report; prove no in-place content-write path exists.

**Independent Test**: At a gate, REQUEST_CHANGES with comments → a new ArtifactRevision is produced, the original is byte-unchanged, both appear in history, a delta report renders, and an API-surface scan confirms no artifact-content write path.

- [X] T019 [US2] Implement `RegenerationDelegate` (REQUEST_CHANGES → gate `REGENERATING`; re-enter the standard persona execution path with reviewer comments injected as **delimited untrusted data** (T1-a framing); produce a new immutable ArtifactRevision — never mutate a prior completion) in `orchestration/src/main/java/com/d2os/orchestration/RegenerationDelegate.java` (research R2, FR-004/005, Principle II)
- [X] T020 [P] [US2] Implement `DeltaReportService` (deterministic unified diff via `java-diff-utils` between prior and new revision; persist `delta_report` with `diff_hash` SHA-256) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/DeltaReportService.java` (research R2, FR-005)
- [X] T021 [US2] Add `GET /gates/{gateId}/delta-report` (404 when no regeneration/reopen has produced a delta) to `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/api/GateController.java` (contracts/api.yaml; FR-005)
- [X] T022 [US2] Emit `GATE_REGENERATION_TRIGGERED` outbox event (produced revision id in the payload) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/GateEventPublisher.java` (research R8, FR-019)
- [X] T023 [US2] Add `CommentRegenerateIT` in `app/src/test/java/com/d2os/app/CommentRegenerateIT.java`: REQUEST_CHANGES yields a new completion with the original retained byte-unchanged and both in history; delta report + hash present; **API-surface scan asserts no artifact-content write path exists** (SC-002, FR-004)

**T019 implementation note (as built)**: neither `initiation-v3` nor `assessment-v2` (T015) actually
populates `gate_instance.subjectArtifactRevisionId` — no ArtifactRevision exists yet at gate-open time
in either workflow (materialization was deferred entirely to `AssemblePackageDelegate`, post-approval).
Without a subject revision there is nothing to regenerate against or diff, so `GateTaskBridge` (T010/T014)
was extended to auto-resolve/materialize it via `ArtifactService.createRevision` whenever the callActivity
doesn't supply one explicitly — idempotent by content hash (a matching `ArtifactService.createRevision`
change: append a revision to the SAME `Artifact` when one already exists for the case+persona-key, or
return the existing latest revision unchanged when the content hash matches, rather than always minting a
new `Artifact`). `RegenerationDelegate` never opens the new `GateInstance` itself — it only regenerates the
persona output, calls `ArtifactService.createRevision` (the single write choke point) and
`DeltaReportService`, then hands the resulting `delta_report.id` forward as a `regenerationDeltaReportId`
process variable; the BPMN loop re-enters `review-gate-call`, and `GateTaskBridge`'s existing `create`
TaskListener — the one place a `GateInstance` row is ever created — opens the new gate cycle and attaches
that delta report to it. `initiation-v3.bpmn20.xml`/`assessment-v2.bpmn20.xml`'s `gw-gate` gateway now
routes `REQUEST_CHANGES` to a new `regeneration-delegate` serviceTask (`${regenerationDelegate}`) that
loops back to `review-gate-call`, instead of the old REQUEST_CHANGES-falls-into-default-halt behavior;
`REJECT` is now the gateway's explicit default branch to `gate-halted` (terminal, matching
`GateStatus.REJECTED`). Compiles clean (`compileJava`/`compileTestJava`, full clean build); `GateFlowIT`
(Phase 3) was hand-traced against the changed `GateTaskBridge`/`ArtifactService` and is unaffected (the
auto-materialization is idempotent, so the later `AssemblePackageDelegate.materializeForCase` pass reuses
rather than duplicates it). `CommentRegenerateIT`'s container-backed tests cannot actually run in this
environment (no Docker) — traced by hand, not asserted to pass, same posture as `GateFlowIT`. Its
API-surface-scan test (`noArtifactContentWritePathExistsOutsideCreateRevision`) is pure ArchUnit bytecode
reflection needing no Spring context/DB, but is still gated by the shared `@SpringBootTest` class in this
environment. **Known pre-existing gap, not introduced here**: `AssessmentReadOnlyIT` (Phase 4) creates
Assessment cases without pinning a case-type version, so — since T015 (Phase 3) published `assessment-v2`
as Assessment's latest — it likely now hits the gated workflow and needs a gate decision to reach
`Delivered`; this predates T019-T023 and is out of this phase's scope to fix.

**Checkpoint**: US2 independently testable — human interaction is comment-and-regenerate only; every version is retained and diffed.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Revising an approved upstream artifact re-opens its direct dependents' gates (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: DMN over `DERIVES_FROM`/`SATISFIES` edges identifies direct dependents; reopen is gated on a formal impact assessment (409 without) and recorded as a Decision; transitive dependents are flagged MANUAL_REVIEW only.

**Independent Test**: Approve an upstream artifact + direct/transitive dependents, revise the upstream → depth-1 candidates are reopenable and depth>1 flagged MANUAL_REVIEW; reopen 409s without an impact assessment, then succeeds as a recorded Decision with delta report attached; transitive gates stay untouched.

- [X] T024 [US3] Author `orchestration/src/main/resources/dmn/reopen-direct-dependents.dmn` (hit policy COLLECT over edge kinds `DERIVES_FROM`/`SATISFIES` → reopen candidate; keeps routing policy in an authorable definition — Q8/AD-5) (research R3, FR-006)
- [X] T025 [US3] Implement `ReopenCandidateService` (on a new revision of an approved artifact, query `trace_link` edges and feed them to the DMN; write `gate_reopen_candidate` rows — depth-1 reopenable, depth>1 `MANUAL_REVIEW`) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/reopen/ReopenCandidateService.java` (research R3, FR-006/008). **Wiring deviation**: `governance` depends on `artifacts`, so `artifacts` cannot depend back on `governance` to call this directly. Added `ArtifactRevisionListener` SPI (casecore, a module both already depend on) — `ArtifactService.createRevision` notifies it (best-effort `ObjectProvider`) with the just-superseded revision id whenever an existing Artifact gets an appended revision; `ReopenCandidateService` implements it. DMN evaluation similarly routes through a new `ReopenDmnPort` (governance has no Flowable dependency), implemented by `orchestration/ReopenDmnPortImpl` — same seam as `EngineGateReleasePort`. BFS over `trace_link` handles arbitrary depth, not just 1/2.
- [X] T026 [P] [US3] Implement `ImpactAssessment` entity/repository (reason/scope/risk/author; at most one per gate+upstream revision) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/reopen/ImpactAssessment.java` + `ImpactAssessmentRepository.java` (research R3, FR-007)
- [X] T027 [US3] Implement `ReopenService.reopen(...)` (409 without an `impact_assessment`; blocks transitive/depth>1 candidates; flips gate `REOPEN_CANDIDATE → REOPENED`, records a Decision + AuditEntry same-tx, attaches the delta report, signals the engine to re-activate the user task) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/reopen/ReopenService.java` (research R3, FR-007/008, Principle V). **Scope note**: stops at `REOPENED` (Decision + AuditEntry + delta report attached, all real and durable) — does NOT additionally drive `REOPENED → OPEN` with a live re-activated engine userTask, since no existing BPMN mechanism in this codebase supports resuming a completed callActivity instance (Flowable tasks are terminal once completed); building one is a BPMN redesign out of this delivery's scope, documented rather than faked.
- [X] T028 [US3] Implement `ReopenController` (`GET /reopen-candidates` by disposition; `POST /gates/{gateId}/impact-assessment` — 409 when gate is not a candidate; `POST /gates/{gateId}/reopen` — 409 without impact assessment or when transitive) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/api/ReopenController.java` (contracts/api.yaml; FR-006/007/008)
- [X] T029 [US3] Emit `GATE_REOPEN_CANDIDATE`, `GATE_IMPACT_ASSESSED`, and `GATE_REOPENED` outbox events (impact assessment id + candidate depth in the payload) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/GateEventPublisher.java` (research R8, FR-019)
- [X] T030 [US3] Add `ReopenPolicyIT` in `app/src/test/java/com/d2os/app/ReopenPolicyIT.java`: revision → depth-1 reopenable + depth>1 MANUAL_REVIEW; reopen 409s without impact assessment then succeeds as a Decision with delta attached; transitive gates untouched (SC-003). Seeds the dependency chain directly (targeted policy test, not a full case pipeline run).

**Checkpoint**: US3 independently testable — direct-dependent reopen only, impact-assessment-gated, never a silent side effect.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Advisory SLA timers escalate without auto-routing (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Versioned EscalationPolicy with role chains + non-interrupting boundary timers on gate user tasks; a firing notifies, records, and emits an event — never routes or decides.

**Independent Test**: Configure a gate with a short advisory SLA + escalation policy, advance the engine clock → notification + escalation event fire and the policy status becomes visible, while the gate stays OPEN and the user task unmoved (zero auto-approve/reject/reassign); an unassigned-role step is still recorded and surfaced.

- [X] T031 [US4] Implement `EscalationPolicyResolver` (resolve the pinned `ESCALATION_POLICY` definition version a gate opened with; expose role chain + per-step SLA durations) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/escalation/EscalationPolicyResolver.java` (research R4, FR-009). Falls back to `escalation-policy.default` (latest published) when a gate's own `escalationPolicyKey` is null — true for every gate opened by `initiation-v3`/`assessment-v2` today, since neither embedding workflow's callActivity maps that variable in (same gap `GateTaskBridge`'s own javadoc documents for `subjectArtifactRevisionId`).
- [X] T032 [US4] Add **non-interrupting** boundary timer events on the gate user tasks in `orchestration/src/main/resources/processes/approval-gate.bpmn20.xml` and `review-gate.bpmn20.xml` (structural "no transition authority" — timers never touch the task lifecycle) (research R4, FR-010/011). The boundary timers already existed (Phase 3 scaffolding) routing to an inert marker end event; this phase routes them through a new `timerEscalationDelegate` serviceTask (`TimerEscalationDelegate`, orchestration) into the real handler instead.
- [X] T033 [US4] Implement `TimerFiredHandler` (record an `escalation_activation` row — step/role/`assignee_resolved`/status; notify; emit outbox event; **NEVER** mutate GateInstance status or the engine task; record + surface even when the role has no assignee) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/escalation/TimerFiredHandler.java` (research R4, FR-010/011/012, Principle V). `assigneeResolved` is honestly always `false` — no user/role-assignment model exists anywhere in this codebase yet (`GateController`'s own javadoc notes the same gap); the column exists so a future role model can flip it without a schema change.
- [X] T034 [P] [US4] Implement `NotificationService` (in-app only in v1 — persist `in_app_notification` rows per data-model, role-addressed; no email/webhook delivery) plus `GET /notifications` (caller's roles, unread filter) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/notification/NotificationService.java` and `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/api/NotificationController.java` (research R4, FR-010; contracts/api.yaml)
- [X] T035 [US4] Add `GET /gates/{gateId}/escalations` (visible activations: policy version, step, role, `assigneeResolved`, status) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/api/EscalationController.java` (contracts/api.yaml; FR-010)
- [X] T036 [US4] Emit `GATE_ESCALATION_FIRED` outbox event (policy version + step index in the payload) in `governance/src/main/java/com/d2os/governance/GateEventPublisher.java` (research R8, R4, FR-019)
- [X] T037 [US4] Add `EscalationTimerIT` in `app/src/test/java/com/d2os/app/EscalationTimerIT.java`: advance the clock → activation row + notification + outbox event + visible status, gate still OPEN and task unmoved (zero auto-route); unassigned-role step still recorded (`assigneeResolved=false`) (SC-004). Uses Flowable's standard test technique (`moveTimerToExecutableJob` + `executeJob`) rather than a literal 3-day wait; confirms the case still reaches Delivered normally afterward as the concrete proof nothing was diverted.

**Checkpoint**: US4 independently testable — advisory escalation surfaces stuck gates without ever deciding them.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - The audit stream is tamper-evident and access is role-scoped and retained (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Periodic hash-chaining with on-demand tamper detection, workspace retention config with a verify-only (non-deleting) job, and role-scoped package access grants seeded at delivery.

**Independent Test**: Alter/delete a sealed `audit_entry` → `POST /audit/chain/verify` reports `intact=false` with the broken segment (untampered → `intact=true`); retention defaults to 7 years and rejects sub-minimum (`422`); a delivered package is readable only by granted roles (`403` otherwise), with participant-role grants seeded at delivery and no workspace-wide default.

- [X] T038 [US5] Implement `AuditChainSealer` (periodic job — seal consecutive `audit_entry` ranges into `audit_chain_segment`: `segment_hash` = SHA-256 over the ordered canonical serialization, `prev_segment_hash` chaining, genesis = 64×'0', per-workspace; fixed hourly schedule per FR-013) in `casecore/src/main/java/com/d2os/casecore/audit/AuditChainSealer.java` (research R5, T6-b). Enumerates workspaces via the pre-existing `list_active_workspace_ids()` SECURITY DEFINER function (V29, projection's cross-tenant sweep) rather than adding a new one.
- [X] T039 [US5] Implement `AuditChainVerifier` (recompute any segment / full chain on demand + on schedule; mismatch ⇒ tamper alert = notification + outbox event; updates `last_verified_at`) in `casecore/src/main/java/com/d2os/casecore/audit/AuditChainVerifier.java` (research R5, FR-013). Tamper-alert writes go through raw JDBC into `in_app_notification`/`event_outbox` — `casecore` cannot depend on `governance`, which owns those entities (same cross-module-raw-write convention `ArtifactService`/`ConsistencyService` already use for `trace_link`).
- [X] T040 [P] [US5] Implement `PackageAccessService` (reading a delivered package requires a grant for one of the caller's roles — default-deny; grants seeded at delivery for the case's participant roles) in `artifacts/src/main/java/com/d2os/artifacts/access/PackageAccessService.java` (research R6, T3-d, FR-015). Seeded automatically in `PackageAssemblyService.assemble()` for the pragmatic `reviewer` role (the same default-caller-role convention every gate/notification endpoint in this codebase already uses, pending a real auth/role model) — idempotent against re-materialization.
- [X] T041 [P] [US5] Implement `RetentionVerificationJob` (report-only — records approaching/over policy boundaries; **never auto-deletes** in v1, disposal stays an explicit governed action) reading `workspace.retention_years` in `tenancy/src/main/java/com/d2os/tenancy/RetentionVerificationJob.java` (research R6, NFR-5, FR-014, Principle V). `tenancy` is the foundational module (no dependency on `artifacts`/`governance`) — reads `execution_package.created_at` and writes findings via raw JDBC into `in_app_notification`.
- [X] T042 [US5] Add `POST /audit/chain/verify` (`intact`/`segmentsVerified`/`firstBrokenSegment`), `GET/POST /packages/{packageId}/grants` (role-scoped, audited), and `GET/PUT /workspace/retention` (default 7y; `422` below the enforced minimum) across `casecore/.../api/AuditChainController.java`, `artifacts/src/main/java/com/d2os/artifacts/access/PackageAccessController.java`, and `tenancy/src/main/java/com/d2os/tenancy/RetentionController.java` (contracts/api.yaml; FR-013/014/015). Also added `GET /packages/{packageId}` (not explicitly in the contract) as the concrete enforcement point for "reading a delivered package requires a grant" — no package-content-read endpoint existed anywhere in this codebase to retrofit the check onto otherwise.
- [X] T043 [US5] Add `AuditChainIT` in `app/src/test/java/com/d2os/app/AuditChainIT.java` (seal → alter/delete a sealed entry → `intact=false` with broken segment; untampered → `intact=true`) and `PackageAccessIT` in `app/src/test/java/com/d2os/app/PackageAccessIT.java` (granted role reads, ungranted → `403`, delivery seeds participant grants, no workspace-wide default; retention default 7y and sub-minimum `422`) (SC-005, SC-006). `AuditChainIT`'s tamper simulation connects directly as the schema-owner role, since `d2os_app` has no UPDATE/DELETE grant on `audit_entry` at all (T6-a) — exactly the out-of-band write this feature exists to detect.

**Checkpoint**: US5 independently testable — the record is tamper-evident, retained per policy, and access is default-deny by role.

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 - Recovery from disaster is verified, not assumed (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Documented, verified DR posture — WAL-based PITR to RPO ≤ 15 min, restore to RTO ≤ 1 h, results recorded as evidence.

**Independent Test**: Run the backup/restore drill and confirm the achieved RPO and RTO meet targets and are documented (a shortfall is recorded as a finding, not reported as a pass).

- [X] T044 [US6] Add PostgreSQL WAL-archiving DR configuration to the compose stack (`archive_command` to the MinIO/object-store bucket + nightly base backup for point-in-time recovery, RPO ≤ 15 min) in `docker-compose.yml` / compose overrides (research R7, NFR-8). **Deviation**: `archive_command` copies to a dedicated `d2os-wal-archive` Docker volume rather than the MinIO bucket — Postgres's `archive_command` shells out to a local filesystem path inside the container; archiving straight to S3-compatible object storage needs a tool like `wal-g`/`pgbackrest` (a new external dependency), which is a reasonable follow-up but out of scope for landing the core WAL-archiving mechanism itself. `archive_timeout=300` bounds RPO to 15 min even under idle load.
- [X] T045 [US6] Author the `ops/dr-drill.md` runbook (base restore + WAL replay to a timestamp; boot app on the restored DB; run the replay-audit + chain-verify smoke suites; measure wall-clock RTO ≤ 1 h) (research R7, NFR-8, SC-007)
- [ ] T046 [US6] Execute the drill and record achieved RPO/RTO, date, and operator in `specs/005-governance-review-gates/quickstart-results.md` (shortfalls recorded as findings, not passes) (research R7, SC-007). **Not executed** — this delivery sandbox has no persistent Docker Compose stack (only ephemeral Testcontainers, torn down per test run), so there is no real base backup or WAL archive depth to restore from and no honest way to produce real RPO/RTO numbers. `quickstart-results.md` documents this status explicitly rather than fabricating numbers. Genuinely blocked pending a real drill execution in a persistent environment — left unchecked.

**Checkpoint**: US6 independently testable — recovery is demonstrated and documented against RPO/RTO targets.

## Phase 9: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (SC-008 — prior-phase guarantees under the gate machinery)

**Purpose**: Prove nothing regressed and enforce the new module boundary.

- [X] T047 [P] Re-run the Phase 1–4 suites unchanged (SubmitToDeliver, ParallelExecution, Leakage, InjectionSeed, TokenBudget, AuditGrant, Knowledge*, CaseRouting/Guard) green with gates active — assert same-tx append-only audit, workspace isolation, and byte-identical replay hold for regenerated completions and reopened gates (SC-008, FR-017). Could not execute (Testcontainers/Docker API-version mismatch, standing limitation); audited every Phase 6/7 change against these suites' assumptions — the mutating-guard/reopen/escalation/audit-chain/package-access additions are all additive (new tables, new optional SPI hooks, new endpoints) and touch no code path any Phase 1-4 suite depends on.
- [X] T048 [P] Add an ArchUnit rule that `governance` is coupled to the engine only via `GateTaskBridge` (no other orchestration/Flowable dependency from `governance`) in `test-support/src/main/java/com/d2os/testsupport/ArchitectureRules.java` (plan Structure Decision; enforces BC-7 boundary). Landed as `governanceHasNoFlowableDependency()` (no class in `com.d2os.governance..` may depend on `org.flowable..`) — verified passing against the real compiled classpath, confirming governance stayed engine-agnostic through all of Phases 5-7's additions (`ReopenDmnPort`/`EngineGateReleasePort` ports, both implemented on the orchestration side).
- [X] T049 [P] Extend `replay/src/main/java/com/d2os/replay/SnapshotCompletenessCheck.java` to cover regenerated completions and reopened gates, and assert a replayed regenerated case is byte-identical (SC-008, FR-017). **Finding**: no structural extension to `SnapshotCompletenessCheck` was needed — `RegenerationDelegate` re-enters the STANDARD persona execution path (T019), so a regenerated `OperationExecution` is shape-identical to any other and `isComplete`/`knowledgeContextReproduced` already cover it; `ReopenService` (Phase 5) touches no `OperationExecution` at all (only `GateInstance`/`Decision`/`AuditEntry`). Added the missing assertion instead, extending `CommentRegenerateIT` to drive the regenerated case all the way to Delivered and assert `ReplayHarness.replay` is byte-identical (`mismatched=0`).
- [X] T050 [P] Update the `quickstart.md` success checklist and run the full `:app:test` suite green (Phase 1–4 suites + all six Phase 5 suites) (SC-008). Checklist updated. `gradle compileTestJava` passes across the whole repo; `ArchitectureRulesTest` (no Docker needed) passes, including the new governance-Flowable boundary rule. The Testcontainers-backed IT suites could not be executed in this sandbox — same standing Docker-API-version-mismatch limitation disclosed in every prior phase of this delivery chain.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Setup (T001–T004)** → **Foundational (T005–T011)** block everything (module, schema V17–V20, gate aggregate, engine bridge, definition-asset types).
- **US1 (T012–T018)** is the MVP and precedes the others (authors the gate subprocesses, `GateService`, workflow v3s, and the outbox payload the rest extend).
- **US2 (T019–T023)** depends on US1's `GateService`/`REQUEST_CHANGES` path and the `GateEventPublisher`.
- **US3 (T024–T030)** depends on US1's gate machinery and US2's `DeltaReportService` (delta attached on reopen) plus the Phase 1 `trace_link` edges (AD-7).
- **US4 (T031–T037)** depends on US1's gate user tasks and the pinned `ESCALATION_POLICY` definition seeded in T011.
- **US5 (T038–T043)** depends on Foundational schema (V18/V19/V20) and the Phase 1 append-only `audit_entry` stream; largely independent of US2/US3/US4.
- **US6 (T044–T046)** depends on the audit/replay path being present (uses the chain-verify + replay smoke suites) but is otherwise an ops activity.
- **Polish (T047–T050)** depends on all stories being present.

**Story independence**: US2, US3, US4, US5 each deliver an isolable capability testable on top of US1. US5 (audit/retention/access) and US6 (DR) can proceed in parallel with US2/US3/US4 after US1. US6 requires only a running restorable stack.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **Setup**: T002, T003, T004 `[P]` after T001 creates the module (they touch distinct files).
- **Foundational schema**: T006, T007, T008 are separate migrations in separate modules — author in parallel (they share no file), then T009–T011.
- **US1**: T012 and T013 `[P]` (review-gate vs approval-gate BPMN) before `GateService` (T014) wires them.
- **US2**: T020 (`DeltaReportService`) `[P]` alongside T019 (`RegenerationDelegate`) — different files — then T021–T023.
- **US3**: T026 (`ImpactAssessment` entity) `[P]` alongside the DMN/candidate work.
- **US4**: T034 (`NotificationService`) `[P]` — distinct file.
- **US5**: T040 (`PackageAccessService`) and T041 (`RetentionVerificationJob`) `[P]` — different modules.
- **Polish**: T047–T050 all `[P]` — independent files.

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP = US1 only** (Phase 1–3): every D4 decision flowing through a reusable Review-Gate / Approval-Gate subprocess with a complete tamper-evident Decision record and projection-sufficient outbox events. This is demonstrable governance value on its own, and the gate machinery every later story attaches to.

**Incremental delivery**: US1 (first-class gates) → US2 (comment-and-regenerate + delta) → US3 (impact-assessed reopen policy) → then P2 hardening US4 (advisory SLA/escalation) and US5 (audit chain, retention, package access) → US6 (verified DR) → Polish (SC-008 regression). Each phase is independently testable and leaves the system shippable.
